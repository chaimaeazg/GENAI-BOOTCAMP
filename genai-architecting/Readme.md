## Functional Requirements

The company aims to own their computing systems rather than use cloud services. This decision stems from worries about keeping user information secure and concerns that AI service providers might significantly increase their prices in the future.
They want to purchase a high-performance computer for AI tasks with a budget between $10,000-15,000. Their user base consists of 300 active students, all located within Madrid city limits.

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware specifications needed:

    High-end GPU capable of running AI models
    Sufficient RAM for concurrent user sessions
    Fast storage solutions for database access
    Reliable cooling system for 24/7 operation


### Network requirements:

    High-speed internet connection
    Backup connection for redundancy
    Local network optimization

## Assumptions

We believe that freely available AI models will be able to perform adequately on computer hardware within our $10-15K budget range.
Our plan involves setting up a single computer in our office with an internet connection, which we expect will have sufficient capacity to handle all 300 students.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks:

Hardware failure scenarios
Network connectivity issues
Model performance limitations


### Business Risks:

Future model compatibility
Scaling limitations
Maintenance costs


### Security Risks:

Data breach prevention
Access control
Backup procedures

## Data Strategy

Due to copyright restrictions, we plan to purchase legitimate educational content and store it in our own database system for student access.

## Considerations

We're looking at IBM Granite as our preferred AI model because it's completely open-source and comes with transparent training data documentation. This helps us avoid copyright problems and gives us clear insight into how the model operates.
