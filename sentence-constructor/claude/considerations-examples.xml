           Considerations and Next Steps:

           - This sentence uses "therefore" as a connection between two ideas
           - In Spanish, we often use "por lo tanto" or "entonces" to show cause and effect
           - The first part describes a state (being cold) in a location
           - The second part describes an action that needs to be done
           - Consider how to express "need to" in Spanish - this is often done with "tener que" or "deber"
           - The word order will be similar to English, with some variations

           You can:

           - Try forming the first part about it being cold
           - Ask about how to connect two ideas with "therefore"
           - Ask about how to express "need to" in Spanish
