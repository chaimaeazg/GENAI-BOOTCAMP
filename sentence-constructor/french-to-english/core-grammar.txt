The 10 Essential French Grammar Rules for Beginners

1. Gender of Nouns

French nouns are either masculine (le) or feminine (la)
There is no neutral gender
Memorize the gender of each new noun

2. Article Agreement

Articles must match the noun's gender and number
Masculine: le, un
Feminine: la, une
Plural: les, des

3. Adjective Agreement

Adjectives change form to match the noun's gender and number
Feminine: usually add -e (e.g., petit → petite)
Plural: usually add -s (e.g., petit → petits)

4. Subject Pronouns

Use subject pronouns to indicate the sentence's subject
Singular: je (I), tu (you, informal), il/elle (he/she)
Plural: nous (we), vous (you, formal/plural), ils/elles (they)

5. Present Tense Conjugation

French verbs are grouped into three main categories: -er, -ir, -re
Each group has its own conjugation patterns
Irregular verbs (être, avoir, aller) have unique patterns

6. Negation

Use the two-part negation: ne...pas
Place ne before the verb and pas after
Example: Je ne mange pas (I don't eat)

7. Question Formation

Use rising intonation to form questions
Add est-ce que before a statement to form a question
Invert the verb and subject to form a question

8. Possessive Adjectives

Possessive adjectives change form based on the possessed noun's gender
Mon/ma/mes (my), ton/ta/tes (your), son/sa/ses (his/her)

9. Position of Adjectives

Most adjectives are placed after the noun
BAGS adjectives (beauty, age, goodness, size) are placed before the noun
Example: une grande maison (a big house)

10. Formal vs. Informal Address

Use tu for informal, single-person address
Use vous for formal or plural address
Using the wrong form can be a social faux pas
