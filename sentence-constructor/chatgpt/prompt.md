## Formating Instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
    vocabulary table 
    sentence structure 
    clues and considerations

### Vocabulary Table 

- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- the table of vocablary should only have the following columns: Spanish, English
### Sentence Structure

- Do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.

### Clues and Considerations

- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the spanish words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table
